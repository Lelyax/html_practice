                    <p1>Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. Where? Anywhere! Oh!! Luke! Luke!</p1> <img src="resources/css/img/other.jpg" />
                    <p>We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Enemy fighters coming your way. You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>

                    <p>Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father?</p> <img src="resources/css/img/photos.jpg" /> </div>

                    <p>Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. There she is. See-Threepio, do you copy? For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. We're right above you. Stand by. You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought.</p>

                    <p>General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.</p>

                    <p>Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. That's what I'm afraid of. Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. You're who? I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi.</p>
